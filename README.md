The webpage is to display list of Movies and their Year of release from a database of 100 Movies. These details are displayed 20 at a time.

###### `What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?`
######  I used the step by step instruction available on Heroku for developing Node.js project and it was really helpful. I was able to deply the project easily with no deployment issue.

###### `What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?`
###### The integration of Postgres and Node.js was not simple at all. I had issues importing dumps from my Mac, for this I had to use a friends windows computer, as the dump command was not running on my mac. I later created the project using the steps mentioned on Heroku and it was only then when it started working.

###### `If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?`
###### I would use some other database rather than Postgres to handle my database.
